# Firmware binary placeholder
# Place firmware.bin file here

The firmware.bin file should be the compiled firmware binary from PlatformIO.

To generate the firmware binary:
1. Build the project in PlatformIO: `pio run -e jboard16`
2. The firmware binary will be located at: `.pio/build/jboard16/firmware.bin`
3. Copy the firmware binary to this directory
4. Calculate SHA256 checksum: `sha256sum firmware.bin`
5. Update the checksum in manifest.json and versions.json
